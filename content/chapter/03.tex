\chapter{Apache Lucene}

Apache Lucene is an open source full-text search engine library based on Java [1]. It provides several Application Programming Interfaces for search functions such as indexing, querying or language analysis [1].

The Lucene project was started in 1997 by Doug Cutting and donated to The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) in 2001 [1]. Today it is maintained by several contributors and committers of the ASF, who are being paid by their respective employers to work on Lucene [1]

Lucene consists of four main features - the analysis of incoming content and queries, indexing and storage, searching and additional modules [1]. The Lucene core includes the first three features, while the fourth contains useful code libraries for solving typical search-related problems such as result highlighting [1].

The analysis component of Lucene is responsible for converting incoming documents or search queries into an appropriate internal representation [1]. Therefore the data is filtered, normalized and tokenized before the created tokens are inserted into the search index [1].

Lucene uses a so called inverted index, which means that it maps keywords to pages instead of mapping pages to keywords [2]. This method can be compared to a glossary at the end of a book and allows for faster search responses as it searches through the keyword index, instead of through the complete documents [2].

The database allows to index and store user defined documents, where a document is a collection of fields and each field has a value assigned to it [1, 2]. A document can consist of plain text as well as being a database or a collection [2]. 
Data can be queried using multiple query representations [1]. Detailed information and examples on some of these query options will be given in chapter 6.1.

Apache Lucene is the search engine library used by Elasticsearch to provide a scalable, high-performance full-text indexing and searching [3].
